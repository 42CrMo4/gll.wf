# Focus on what you want to do
This site is, and will increasingly be, a collection of documentation of useful (at least for me personally) best practices / standards to follow.
These are tailored to a workshop with the two main areas of productivity. 
- Electronics 
- 3D printing 
It aims to make life easier and avoid adding overhead by potentially doing the same thing in different ways and spending time and effort on an already solved problem. 
It does not claim to be unique or the best.

# Feedback
